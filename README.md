# CSP-Map-coloring-using-Backtracking

This Python code tackles the issue of map coloring that's part of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). It uses the Backtracking algorithm and assigns different colors to map areas. The catch is, areas next to each other can't have matching colors.
The function called is_valid gives a nod to a color allocated to an area if it meets the condition. It does this by looking at surrounding areas on the map. The key function, solve_map_coloring, looks into possible color allocations for all areas, one by one. If an assignment causes problems, it steps back to undo the conflict.

RephraseThe system starts by choosing a section without a color. It reviews possible hues and methodically advances. If it can accordingly color all sections, the color arrangement is given. The coding next sets up an example map showcasing regions and their neighbors, also a palette of colors.
RephraseWhen run, the system tries to get a working color combination for the map. If it wins, it shares the right coloring arrangement. If not, it shows that no suitable coloring can happen.

Here's a code, using the method of backtracking to find a solution for map color issues. It shows strong skills in creating stride, recursion usage, and managing constraints. This model provides a good example of its use to sort out a map problem.
