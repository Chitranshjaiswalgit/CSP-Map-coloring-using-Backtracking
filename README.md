# CSP-Map-coloring-using-Backtracking
 The code uses backtracking to solve the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) of map coloring. It checks if assigning colors to regions follows the constraint that no adjacent regions have the same color. The skills involved include algorithm design for backtracking, recursion, and solving CSP problems. The implementation uses Python.
